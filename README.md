# Cybersecurity-Portfolio

<p align="center">Hello, I'm Brandon, a dedicated and versatile IT professional with a strong background in systems administration, customer service, and team leadership. I am currently enhancing my skill set by pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Certification through Merit America.

My most recent professional role was with Fox3 Managed Solutions, where I served as a Systems Administrator and Customer Service Specialist. In this position, I was responsible for assisting customers with their game server issues, onboarding new clients, managing support tickets through Discord, and overseeing the company's merchandise store.

In addition to my professional experience, I am actively involved in the community as a Dev Team Lead at Rocket Underground. Here, I lead a team of developers in creating, maintaining, and managing the league's supporting applications. My work involves using Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with Jenkins, and technologies like Java and Docker to ensure efficient and effective project delivery.

Earlier in my career, I worked as a Delivery Driver at Domino's Pizza, where I honed my customer service skills by ensuring timely and accurate deliveries.

I am passionate about cybersecurity and technology, and I am eager to leverage my diverse experience and newly acquired cybersecurity skills in a dynamic and challenging environment.</p>
